# Line Follower 1.0

### Project Description: 
The idea behind the project was to develop a concept car that moves automatically on a line . The concept scans the ground and determines the right moment to accelerate or decelerate one of the motors to move left or right along the line. When you press the start button, the concept calibrates itself by repeatedly moving left and right.
### Instructions: 
To use the concept car, you need to restart the Arduino board and place the concept over the black line, noting that the line should be just below the centre of the sensor. After a few seconds, the concept car will start moving along the line. To stop the process, simply disconnect the battery.
### Used Components: 
* Arduino Uno
* Zip-ties
* Power source, a LiPo battery
* Wheels (2)
* Wires for the line sensor (female - male)
* QTR-8A reflectance sensor, along with screws
* Ball caster
* Extra wires from the kit or lab
* Chassis
* Breadboard - medium (400pts)
* L293D motor driver
* DC motors (2)
